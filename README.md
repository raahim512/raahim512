## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Raahim. I'm a self taught developer and OS enthusiast with a passion for everything CompSci. I'm Currently diving deep into Windows internals, virtualization and cybersecurity.

### Featured projects:
- **Forum/Social Media:**<br>I built a little messageboard website for the "Code2Success" Python programming competition in my school back in 2023. It was built with Flask and HTML/CSS as a forum for students, parents and teachers to express their ideas in a safe online space.
- **GDI Malware:**<br>Inspired by YouTube classics like Solaris.exe and Sulfoxide.exe. I've made versions of my own using only Python by utilizing Windows API functionality (such as the Graphics Device Interface) to produce colorful and stroke-inducing visuals coupled with a deadly payload that can brick any hard drive's MBR. (DISCLAIMER! Just for educational purposes!)

### Languages and tools I work with:
- Python (Flask, pywin32, win32gui)
- HTML, CSS, (some JS, but still learning!)
- Windows internals (Registry, NTFS, Windows API)
- Exploring: OS Architecture, cryptography, cybersecurity

That's all for now, I'll launch a portfolio soon to get everything sorted and nice looking. See you soon!

PS! I'm mostly anti-AI when it comes to programming or anything in general. I'm fascinated by the tech, but definitely wouldn't use it for something like this. I hope this statement makes me more legit!
